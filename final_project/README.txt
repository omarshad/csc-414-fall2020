Some help with the project.

--> Any file to be uploaded must be in the project directory ex. Use d1.jpeg or pic2.jpeg (already given)

--> When downloading, if a peer is not in the network, the peer will attempt to download the file however it will not downloaded.

--> When a file is uploaded, it is put in the local upload folder. (When the torrent is created)
